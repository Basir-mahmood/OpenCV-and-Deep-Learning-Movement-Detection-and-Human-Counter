# OpenCV-and-Deep-Learning-Movement-Detection-and-Human-Counter
###  The model developed is used for the human movement detection that where it is moving and detect the strength of humans towards each counter, left, or right.

Let's suppose, a person comes

The direction of the person is detected, and as it move towards a corner, the counter not only detect its position but also count to where it has moved.
